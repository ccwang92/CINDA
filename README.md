# Welcome to CINDA
CINDA (**Ci**rculation **N**etwork based **D**ata-**a**ssociation) is a minimum-cost circulation framework for solving the global data association problem, which plays a key role in the tracking-by-detection paradigm of multi-object tracking (MOT). CINDA maintains the same optimal solution as the previously widely used minimum-cost flow framework, while enjoys both a better theoretical complexity bound and orders of practical efficiency improvement. The improved computational efficiency is expected to enable more sophisticated tracking framework and yields better tracking accuracy.
